# SfG React Starter

This is a project meant to be cloned and utilized for SfG to spin up React projects a little bit faster. It is by no means a final say so and may/should be modified to your project's specific needs.

- Clone this repository and name it appropriate to your project `git clone git@github.com:softwareforgood/sfg-react.git {your project name}`

## What's here?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It also has a `.nvmrc`, `.prettierrc.json`, and `.eslintrc.json` files. These files are meant to help us standardize our practices. Getting us all to use the same node versions, JS code styles, and linting our stylesheets, so that when other teammates jump into a project they can write code consistent to the project, and across all projects.

## This README

This README has a basic template below. Please update it per your project so that any team member can have a clear understanding of how to contribute, run, and deploy the application.

## Overview

Describe your project here. What it does/will do, what it's written in, and the client's name.

## Setup

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

- Run `yarn` from the theme directory to install dependencies
- Update the following files appropriately:
  - `public/manifest.json`: Name & Short Name
  - `package.json`: Name

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

This repo does include the ability to run tests.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

See the section about [ejecting](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) for more information.

## Deployment

Please update this section as per your project.
